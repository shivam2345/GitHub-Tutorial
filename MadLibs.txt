Mad Libs Theater 

ELF: Hi Santa.

SANTA: Hello Cfgdsafds`.

ELF: You’re looking at me like I’m on your naughty list.

SANTA: I was counting my toys and was one fart short. I believe you stole it.

ELF: But Daddy!

SANTA: I started making that toy in 928. What will little JLo think when he/she wakes up on Christmas morning with nothing under the hibicus?

ELF: I would never steal such a red toy.

SANTA: Where were you the night before Christmas?

ELF: I was with fluffy. We were listening to 
coldplay’s holiday album and making snow cats.

SANTA: Then why did Rudolph see you eating on the roof 7 
milliseconds before the toy went missing?

ELF: That’s a coincidence.

SANTA: The reason I work so hard, is because I get to spread joy to millions of people, and go sit by the fire shaking my eyes while eating chips and drinking margarita.

ELF: Fine, I stole the toy. But I only did it because I wanted to impress  
george cloney.

SANTA: oof, oof, oof Every time there’s a holiday miracle, I sing my favorite Christmas song, Jingle [Plural Noun].
(singing)
Jingle schools, Jingle schools,
Jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open train.

ELF: Merry thanksgiving Santa!
